# Synthetix Bot - Update 2.0

## General Changes

- In this update, we've made several important changes to the Synthetix bot.

## Code Changes

**In the previous response, I provided you with the changes you need to make to your code to work with the JSON file you provided. Here's a more detailed explanation of these changes:**

1. We loaded values from your JSON file using the following code:

   ```python
   with open('channels.json', 'r') as g:
       channel_data = json.load(g)
   ```

2. We extracted the values "statusChannelId" and "memberChannelId" from the JSON file using the following lines:

   ```python
   status_channel_ids = channel_data.get("statusChannelId", [])
   member_channel_id = channel_data.get("memberChannelId", "")
   ```

3. We used the retrieved values in functions like `on_ready()`, `on_disconnect()`, `shutdown()`, `on_member_join()`, and `on_member_remove()` to send messages to the channels listed in the "statusChannelId" and "memberChannelId" arrays. For example, in the `on_ready()` function, we iterate through the channel IDs and send messages to the corresponding channels:

   ```python
   for channel_id in status_channel_ids:
       channel = bot.get_channel(int(channel_id))
       if channel:
           # Create and send a message to the corresponding channel
   ```

   The same approach is applied to other functions where messages need to be sent.

4. For the `/settings` command, we updated values in the JSON file using the following code:

   ```python
   # Data saving
   channel_data.update({"statusChannelId": [statusid]})
   channel_data.update({"memberChannelId": memberid})
   json.dump(channel_data, open('channels.json', 'w'))
   ```

These changes allow your code to use values from the JSON file to determine the channels to send messages to. Additionally, the code updates the values in the JSON file when the `/settings` command is used to configure channels.

## New "Dev Log" Section
To find news you need to find `devlog` folder and here look to `year` which you need, after that to `month` and to `day`
